# Weatherpy
This project is a simple weather application developed using Python's Tkinter and ttkbootstrap libraries. The app allows users to search for the current weather of a specific city by entering the city's name into an input field. The project integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data, including the temperature, weather description, and an icon representing the weather condition.  
Key Features:

The application displays the following information:
      Location: City and country name.
      Weather Icon: A graphical icon that represents the current weather (e.g., sunny, cloudy).
      Temperature: The current temperature in Celsius.
      Description: A brief description of the weather (e.g., clear sky, light rain).
      
Dynamic Background Color: The application's background color changes dynamically based on the weather condition (e.g., clear sky, rain, snow), providing a visually engaging user experience.

Error Handling: If the user enters a city that is not found, the application displays an error message.
